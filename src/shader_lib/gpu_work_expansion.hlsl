    // How does each work item thread know what to work on (how do they know their work item index and their expansion index?)?
    //   * a uint pair per work item would be the simplest solution
    //   * write a pair of uints (work item idx + expansion idx) per work item
    //   * work item threads could use their thread index to index the array of (work item idx, expansion idx) uint pairs
    //   * writing and storing a uint pair per work item is too expensive in runtime and memory.
    //
    // Simple improvement over the uint pair solution:
    //   * we store the first work item thread idx INSIDE the expansion
    //   * allows us to remove the work item index from the uint pair
    //   * work item threads can calculate their work item index via: work_item_idx = thread_idx - expansion.first_thread_idx
    //   * already saves us half the required memory, now we only store an array of expansion indices
    //
    // The limited work item count of each expansion within each bucket (2^i = 2^2 = 4 <-> 2^(i+1)-1 = 2^(2+1)-1 = 7), gives us several guarantees.
    // If we view a range of threads in the bucket of size 2^i = 4 anywhere within the bucket:
    //   * there can be AT MOST two different expansions the threads within the range work on
    //     * this is because the minimum work item count of each expansion is 2^i = 4;
    //       to have more than 2 expansions in a range of 4 threads, we would need expansions with less than 3 work items
    //   * when there is more than one expansion in the range, the second expansion MUST also extend into the next range of 2^i = 4 threads
    //     * this is because the minimum work item count of each expansion is 2^i = 4;
    //       the second expansion would have to be 3 or less work items in order to not reach into the next range of 2^i = 4 threads
    //   * when there is two expansions within a range there MUST BE a range next to the current range of at least 1 thread
    //     * this is because of the previous guarantee
    //
    // Using the first guarantee we know that we only have to store two expansion indices per range!
    // This is already a big improvement compared to storing and writing a expansion index for every thread.
    // For larger bucket sizes, like i = 12 this means we save 4094 of 4096 writes and memory, thats a saving of over 99%.
    // 
    // The other two guarantees give us another big advantage: we only need to store ONE of the two possible expansion indices within each range!
    // For example, if we only store the first expansion index for each range:
    //   * for each range we can load that expansion using the (thread_idx % (2^i = 4)) as index
    //     * load that expansions first thread index
    //     * check if the thread belongs to that expansion (thread_idx < expansion_first_thread_idx + expansion_work_item_count)
    //   * in the case that we have two expansions in the range, some threads will fail this check as they belong to the second expansion of the range.
    //     * it is GUARANTEED that the next range's first expansion also has threads in our range (see above point 3 in the guarantees)!
    //     * as each range stores their first expansion, we can load the first expansion of the next range, all remaining threads must fall into this expansion!
    // 
    // Here is an example of the argument array storing each ranges second expansion index:
    //
    //   Expansion Index:             0  1  2  3
    //   Expansion First Thread:      0  7 11 17
